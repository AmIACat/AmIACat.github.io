            <p>
                Here at Automation Industries, we experience a lot of questions
                surrounding our work. In our FAQ we hope to be able to answer them!

                        lines so that all your products can be manufactured more 
                        cheaply and quickly than ever before!

                        The process begins when you reserve a date for a meeting.
                        During the meeting, you lay out what you need, and we 
                        lay out our requirements and pricing. Then, a contract is 
                        drawn up, and both sides sign. After that, we will follow
                        the terms of the contract until the project is finished or
                        the timeframe is up. If the timeframe runs out before the 
                        project is complete, you can apply for an extension.

                        to assure satisfaction with the work. Every one of 
                        our engineers and coders is certified, and have years
                        of experience. If you are not satisfied with the final
                        result, you can apply for a partial refund, or a full
                        refund while the product is still in the first week. 
                        If you apply for a refund, then any and all work 
                        done by Automation Industries must be returned. This
